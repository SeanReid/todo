Simple Rails app created using BDD. This is simliar to my reminder app but was recreated (somewhat) by using a 'ping pong' approach. This app is less about pretty or functionality and more about the how we get there. My partner and I took a turn or two at writing the test or solution. So I would write a test and she would write the solution, then her test and my solution. We were asked to do this with two turns at both and to utilize our first try with Capybara. Success! 
The functionality is purposely limited to meet time constraints.
